# nahuy
nahuy is an internal project that only our friends are allowed to use.
Despite its name having a Russian swear word in it, its primary use is
to allow users to privately live stream.

I was suggested to work on the frontend of the project, as the previous
designs were not great: they were mostly very basic with both its design
and the way CSS was used. (Not to mention that the main developer
themselves said that it's bad.)

I used Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Sass and TypeScript to create this.
