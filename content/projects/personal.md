# Personal websites
::alert{type="info"}
Albeit being kind of personal, this portfolio does not count as a "personal website."

These websites were not meant to be "professional" in any way, neither were they
used as a "business card site", neither had they any use. They just mostly showcased
visual aids and random things I found funny.

The current one in particular has 3D graphics (made with [three.js](https://threejs.org)).
I made the monitor model using [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io).

The following website is CPU or GPU expensive and can drain your device's battery.

The old page utilized vector graphics and DOM elements, and it was much more simple and
performant.
