# Miscellaneous
The projects that do not deserve their own pages will be displayed here.

## [litterbin.dev](https://litterbin.dev)
I found it pointless to create a website for Litterbin Collective, so the only
thing that it has is a semi-animated Kaomoji button.

## Commission work
### [e621.blue](https://e621.blue)
*DVD mode here may be buggy. Whoops...*

### [piaempi.gay]
I wanted the character on the center to be more "alive" rather than being just
a static image (kind of what [litterbin.dev](https://litterbin.dev) has.) Hence
I made it interactable when I did not need to.
