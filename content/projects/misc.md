# Miscellaneous
The projects that do not deserve their own pages will be displayed here.

## litterbin.dev
I found it pointless to create a website for Litterbin Collective (or was lazy
to create a proper one), so the only thing that it has is a semi-animated
Kaomoji button.

## filerecv-game
An RPG game that isn't finished and will never be.

## Commission work
### e621.blue
DVD mode here may be a bit buggy. Whoops...

### piaempi.gay
::alert{type="info"}
No live preview available (yet, maybe).

I wanted the character on the center to be more "alive" rather than being just
a static image (kind of what [litterbin.dev](https://litterbin.dev) has). Hence
I made it interactable when I did not need to.
