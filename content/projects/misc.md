# Miscellaneous
The projects that do not deserve their own pages will be displayed here.

## litterbin.dev
I found it pointless to create a website for Litterbin Collective, so the only
thing that it has is a semi-animated Kaomoji button.

:vuevideo{src="/videos/kaomoji.mp4"}

## eng.ts
An HTML5 canvas rendering engine/helper. It was supposed to be for a revision
on some project I worked on previously, but I "gave up" and uploaded it on
GitHub.

## filerecv-game
An RPG-style game, that isn't finished and will never be.

## Commission work
### e621.blue
DVD mode here may be a bit buggy. Whoops...

### piaempi.gay
::alert{type="info"}
No live preview available (yet, maybe.)

I wanted the character on the center to be more "alive" rather than being just
a static image (kind of what [litterbin.dev](https://litterbin.dev) has.) Hence
I made it interactable when I did not need to.
